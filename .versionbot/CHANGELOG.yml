              body: >
                Currently, because we bind mount apps.json unconditionally, when
                this

                file doesn't exist, balena engine will create a directory on the
                data

                filesystem. This breaks when we add an apps.json file after the

                supervisor container was already created.

                Under the current configuration we instruct NetworkManager
                through its

                configuration to completely ignore all the tun devices. This was

                enforced as an extra precation as we run an openvpn client which

                connects to the balena-cloud backend. This client creates, on
                the host,

                the interface `resin-tun` currently (rename pending). We want to
                loosen

                up this restriction to only unmanage this specific device -
                `resin-tun`

                - so that users can take advantage of NetworkManager managing
                other tun

                devices.

                bberror does not exit the do_compile task. Add exit 1 to make
                sure that

                if an error is found, the task is marked as failed. Otherwise
                the

                error becomes a heisenbug as bitbake proceeds after do_compile.

              body: >
                63baa421 introduced a bug where the tools in the header tarballs
                were

                compiled with the incorrect HOSTCC parameter. As a result the
                tools

                inside the tarball were compiled for x86-64 instead of the
                native

                device architecture. And they had the incorrect ld interpreter
                path

                as well.


                Update to v0.0.12 to fix that.

                This release also adds objtool support needed by the intel nuc
                image.

                For now only allow `wifi.scan-rand-mac-address` configurable
                from

                config.json using `randomMacAddressScan` as the json key.


                config.json snippet example:


                "os": {
                  "network" : {
                    "wifi": {

                    }
                  }
                }


                We include a set of tests for this tool which are ran at build
                time.

                recipe

                is not in the same directoy as bitbake will not be able to find
                needed

                able to start because of a mnt-sysroot-active.service

                By increasing this timeout, the filesystem symlink should

                already exist, at the time the mnt-sysroot-active service is

                looking for this dependency.

                The original 60s might be slow for some devices where balena
                is busy with a task and the hardware is slow for various
                reasons (ie. Pi1/Zero). In those cases even if the device
                is functioning correctly, the healthcheck will assess the
                device as unhealthy and restart balena and/or the supervisor.

                This patch adds support for translating SSH public keys from
                config.json

                to an authorize_keys file. We use `authorize_keys_local` file as
                the

                destination file of this translation so we can differentiate in
                between keys

                brought locally from config.json and keys brought from the
                balena backend

                through os-config an avoid racing issues with this tool
                (os-config). The final

                `authorize_keys` file will be merged at every ssh connection in
                the dropbear

                service.


                These SSH custom public keys in config.json are assumed to be
                provided

                as an array in `.os.sshKeys`. Example:

                {
                  [...]
                  "os": {
                    "sshKeys": [
                      "ssh-rsa ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ",
                      "ssh-rsa 0123456789"
                    ]
                  },

                This patch replaces the "Client identifier" option from
                DHCP packets sent by NM to resemble the way udhcpc does it.

                The reason is that the Cisco RV325 router with fw older than
                v1.2.1.14 doesn't reply to DHCP requests or discovery packages
                if the "Client identifier" option is formatted in NM's style.

                Even though this is a bug in the router's fw, we are going to
                fix it here because we encountered clients that couldn't get
                an IP address on these routers and we want to avoid that

                which

                allows mobynit to mount a rootfs from a custom path.


                The command ./mobynit -sysroot /mnt/sysroot/inactive will mount

              hash: 3df6e1906e1138a8cd10d15ac3008685b90f75f8
              body: >
                Before multicontainer support in resin, the user container was
                running

                over the host's network stack which means that all the packets
                were

                treated as locally emitted ones. In this case, the communication
                was

                redirected as per the OUTPUT iptable rule only.

                In the "multicontainer world" the user containers run on top of
                bridge

                network which makes the host act as a socksifying router. In
                this case,

                the packets won't go through the OUTPUT chain and the
                redirection to

                redsocks needs to happen at PREROUTING chain.

                This change adds a redirect rule at PREROUTING for TCP packets
                to

                redsocks to redirect packets from the containers to redsocks
                too.


                As well, this adds support for redirecting DNS UDP packets to
                redsocks.

                This is implemented as iptables rules which are only added if
                the

                redsocks configuration has a `dnsu2t` section.

                state

                This recipe adds a few systemd services and scripts that handle

                automated OS rollback functionality.


                The rollback-altboot.service checks if we are running in altboot
                mode

                i.e. resinOS_uEnv.txt says we should boot resin_root_part=3. But
                we are

                actually running resinOS from resin_root_part=2. This can happen
                if

                a reboot happened without clearing upgrade_available in
                resinOS_uEnv

                txt file. A kernel panic happened etc.


                The rollback-altboot script runs hostapp-update hooks to change
                the

                bootfiles.


                The rollback-health.service runs rollback-health which checks if
                vpn is

                online and balena is healthy after a hostapp-update.

                This patch adds a simple check in env_resin.h.


                If bootcount is found to be greater than bootlimit, switch the

                partitions. Both bootcount and bootlimit are standard u-boot env

                variables.


                To enable rollback in devices, devices have to do the following
                in

                their u-boot


                Enable CONFIG_CMD_SETEXPR, CONFIG_BOOTCOUNT_LIMIT and depending
                on the

                device, save the bootcount in some persistant location whether
                that

                is an area in the SoC or an ext partition etc.


                If you are using the CONFIG_BOOTCOUNT_EXT driver, use only the
                boot

                partition and use the filename "bootcount.env"


                E.g. for rpi3

                CONFIG_CMD_SETEXPR=y

                CONFIG_BOOTCOUNT_LIMIT=y

                CONFIG_SYS_BOOTCOUNT_ADDR=0x02300000

                CONFIG_BOOTCOUNT_EXT=y

                CONFIG_SYS_BOOTCOUNT_EXT_DEVPART=0:1

                CONFIG_SYS_BOOTCOUNT_EXT_NAME="bootcount.env"

                Devices that support automated os rollbacks will have two extra

                variables upgrade_available and resin_root_part in their
                grub.cfg

                files.


                Check for the presense of those variables and update them if
                they

                exist.


                Otherwise stick to the previous way of updating grub.cfg


                For devices using grub 2.0, devices will have to mirror the
                pattern

                that exists in u-boot.

                i.e.
                 Add a variable upgrade_available to grub.cfg (HUP hooks update this)
                 Add a variable bootcount to grubenv that increments if
                 upgrade_available is set
                 Add logic in grub.cfg to boot the alternate rootB/A if bootcount
                 reaches 2.

                u-boot uses an upgrade_avaiable flag to update bootcount to
                reduce

                writes to sd card.


                If upgrade_available=0, u-boot won't bother updating the
                bootcount

                variable. During HUP, we'll set upgrade_available=1 so that
                u-boot

                starts counting.


                It'll be the job of the new OS and the rollback services to set

                upgrade_available=0


                For some devices, u-boot will save the bootcount in the boot
                partition

                in /mnt/boot/bootcount.env. Remove that counter when running
                hooks

                | error[E0425]: cannot find function `read_to_string` in module
                `fs`

                |   -->

                libssh2-sys-0.2.11/build.rs:99:26

                let config =
                fs::read_to_string("libssh2/src/libssh2_config_cmake.h.in")

                ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ did you mean `read_string`?


                This is just one example of a package that fails like this.
                There are

                multiple packages in the cargo source tree that fail with this
                error.


                The cargo bbclass does a:

                cargo build -v --target x86_64-linux --release


                This has the following effect:

                NOTE:- cargo build -v --target x86_64-linux --release.

                Updating registry `https://github.com/rust-lang/crates.io-index`


                Updating the registry will result in using the versions pinned
                upstream.

                In our case, it will be using newer versions of packages that
                require a

                newer rust version (read_to_string was added in rust 1.26.0).
                But at the

                same time, the meta-rust layer which we use has an older rust
                version.

                (currently meta-rust on sumo branch has rust at version 1.24.1)


                The fix for such a case would be to use a Cargo.lock file which
                pins

                the packages to versions which are known to work with rust
                1.24.1,

                the version we use in sumo.
